### Arduino Libraries
| **Library**        | **Description**                                          |
|---------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------|
| [Smooth](https://guthub.com/ripred/Smooth) | Keep smooth running averages without using arrays! Uses exponential moving averages and only 8-bytes no matter how many samples! No looping! No Arrays! Constant Compute Time! The sample size is adjustable at runtime. The average is available and accurate even before N samples have been received. Now with Callbacks! |
| [CPUVolt](https://guthub.com/ripred/CPUVolt) | Library for Arduino and ATmega series processors to read the processor's Vcc voltage and percentage of capacity (for battery based projects) using *absolutely* no external components or connections! |
| [CPUTemp](https://guthub.com/ripred/CPUTemp) | Arduino Library to calculate the processors internal temperature using nothing more than the ATmega processor itself! Absolutely no additional components or connections are needed! |
| [TomServo](https://guthub.com/ripred/TomServo) | The TomServo library lets you power multiple servos from a single rechargeable battery. It works by putting the servo control pin into a high-z state when it is not moving so you disable the driving of the servo and greatly reduce the current used by all the servos in your project. |
| [Bang](https://guthub.com/ripred/Bang) | Make your PC/Mac/Linux host a "service" for your Arduino and execute any commands on it's behalf and receive the captured results! Play music, use the PC's disk drive, issue curl commands to post or retrieve anything on the web! The possibilities are endless! |
| [ButtonGestures](https://guthub.com/ripred/ButtonGestures) | Use a single button for up to 6 different functions! Button gestures combinations of single, double, and triple-tap along with a long or short hold on the last press make it easy! Functions can also be pre-registered for callback for the gesture that you want. Even easier! |
| [CompileTime](https://guthub.com/ripred/CompileTime) | Automatically set the hours, minutes and seconds in your project when compiling/uploading! |
| [Profiler](https://guthub.com/ripred/Profiler) | Easily profile your Arduino functions to see how much time they take. The output can be disabled and enabled at runtime. Very lightweight. |
| [fANSI](https://guthub.com/ripred/fANSI) | Arduino library that easily allows sending ANSI control sequences to a PC, Mac, or Linux machine. The PC, Mac, and Linux sides are even easier! Just copy from the serial port directly to the console! ðŸ˜Ž |
| [MyKeywords](https://guthub.com/ripred/MyKeywords) | Define your own custom color-highlighted keywords for the Arduino IDE! |
